\begin{abstract}
This paper uses the new \ac{ACM} \ac{SIG} Proceedings template but removes ACM specific text so that it can be used by students for their assignments.  The paper size has been adjusted to A4. I hope this will be useful.

This paper provides a sample of a \LaTeX\ document which conforms,
somewhat loosely, to the formatting guidelines for
ACM SIG Proceedings.\footnote{This is an abstract footnote}
